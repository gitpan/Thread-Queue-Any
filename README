README for Thread::Queue::Any

Almost drop-in replacement for Thread::Queue that allows any (unshared)
data-structure to be passed between threads by means of a queue.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions if threading has been enabled when building
Perl, or if the "forks" module has been installed on an unthreaded Perl.

Version:
 1.04

Required Modules:
 Test::More (0.88)
 Thread::Queue (any)

This distribution contains two versions of the code: one maintenance version
for versions of perl < 5.14 (known as 'maint'), and the version currently in
development (known as 'blead').  The standard build for your perl version is:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This will test and install the appropriate version of the code for the given
perl executable.  Should you wish to try to use the other version of the
code in a version of Perl that is currently not supported, you can specify
the version of the code to be used:

perl5.8.9-threaded Makefile.PL blead

This will force the testing and installing of the 'blead' version of the code.
Vice-versa, if you want to have the 'maint' version, you can say:

perl5.14.2-threaded Makefile.PL maint

In either case, your mileage may vary.
